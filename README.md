# Arduino-Human-Brain-Interface
Open source Code and files for my DIY EEG interface I made to interface my 3D printed robotic arm to my brain.

Using a toy/game I was able to hack the serial data coming from the EEG headset and send it to the Arduino in order to
control my InMoov 3D printed robotic arm

I was also able to display the values using open source programming Processing.
